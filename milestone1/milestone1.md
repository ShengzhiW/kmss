## Team Proposal

The goal of our team is to create a webapp educating Americans about hurricane preparedness. Our target population would be families and individuals who are living in hurricane prone areas. Our team members aren’t part of our target population because Southern California is not a hurricane prone area. The possible real world data we have looked and are planning to use are data from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data that provides us with datasets about hurricane evacuation routes and national shelter system facilities.


## Features

*   Filtering by location
*   List
    *   What to do in an actual hurricane
*   Foodlist 
    *   Cans etc that they should have stocked in an event of a hurricane
*   Map of all features
    *   Filter by evacuation routes and shelter facilities
*   History of where hurricanes hit
    *   Show a “heat map” of more hurricane-prone areas
*   Live Hurricane Tweets and searches

## Storyboards & Prototyping Ideas

### Storyboard 1
Family who newly moved into a hurricane prone area, previously lived in the west coast and they have no knowledge on how to be prepared in case of an emergency

### Storyboard 2
Someone’s cousin was recently affected by a hurricane and since they both lived in hurricane prone areas, he wanted to educate himself more
