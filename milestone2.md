## Our Application Ideas

Our core idea is still the same from milestone 1, which is to make a hurricane preparedness web app. Our features haven't changed much in terms of the core components. We did decide to add a profile sidebar on the home page because we thought that it would be more functional instead of the page just containing hurricane facts. Our TA  suggested to add email/message notifications to prompt the user to come back to the app whenever there is a hurricane warning/watch. This feature can be edited in the profile settings.



## UI Skeleton

We based our UI Skeleton on our first prototype, where the main focus is on hurricane preparedness and awareness, instead of hurricane maps. As aforementioned, the home screen now includes a profile sidebar, which used to only have hurricane facts and statistics. The second screen of prototype one was a basic checklist. We decided to add more of the "preparedness" aspect in our UI by giving instructions of what to do prior to, during, and after a hurricane.
