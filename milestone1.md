**Team Members:**

**Team Proposal**

The goal of our team is to create a webapp educating Americans about hurricane preparedness. Our target population would be families and individuals who are living in hurricane prone areas. Our team members arenâ€™t part of our target population because Southern California is not a hurricane prone area. The possible real world data we have looked and are planning to use are data from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data that provides us with datasets about hurricane evacuation routes and national shelter system facilities.


**Data and API**

[Evacuation Route Data](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hurricane-evacuation-routes?geometry=-99.092%2C30.473%2C-93.819%2C31.298)

[National Shelter System Facilities](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/national-shelter-system-facilities/data)

[Tornado Tracks](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/historical-tornado-tracks)

[Mobile Homes](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mobile-home-parks)


**Storyboards & Prototyping ideas**

Storyboard 1: Family who newly moved into a hurricane prone area, previously lived in the west coast and they have no knowledge on how to be prepared in case of an emergency
