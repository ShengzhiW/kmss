# How UI skeleton screenshots have improved

We have improved the organization and styling of the UI skeleton. The navigation has been simplified and buttons have been emphasized and made to appear clickable. Our navbar is also responsive on mobile. For Home, we utilized bootstrap to make grids to display data. A UI for getting fun facts has been added. The profile tab on the left no longer takes up a significant amount of space. For Preparations, we added animations and image backgrounds to make the UI more visually appealing and more navigatable. We also shrunk down some of the full-width elements to make it more readable. For the Trending page we've added a twitter feed and a search bar for utilizing the Twitter API.
