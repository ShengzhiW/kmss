# How UI Skeleton has improved

We have improved the styling of the Home Page with a background image that reflects the app's theme.
This background image is layered with a transparent black layer, which helps the actionable elements stand out, compared
to the previous light background.  We've also provided more feedback - previously hovering over My Location, the
cursor would respond as a text cursor.  We've changed it to be a pointer, but also added styling changes on hover so the
button appears lighter and clickable.  Animation entrances was also added to every page, as well as the Hurricane Facts
for each cycle.
