# How UI Skeleton has improved

We have improved the styling of the Home Page with a background image that reflects the app's theme.
This background image is layered with a transparent black layer, which helps the actionable elements stand out, compared
to the previous light background.  We've also provided more feedback - previously hovering over My Location, the
cursor would respond as a text cursor.  We've changed it to be a pointer, but also added styling changes on hover so the
button appears lighter and clickable.  Animation entrances were also added to every page.  Every time a user clicks for a
new Hurricane Fact, the fact will fade in instead of simply changing.
