# How UI Skeleton has improved

We have improved the styling of the Home Page with a background image that reflects the app's theme. This background image is layered with a transparent black layer, which helps the actionable elements stand out, compared to the previous light background.  We've also provided more feedback - previously hovering over My Location, the cursor would respond as a text cursor.  We've changed it to be a pointer, but also added styling changes on hover so the button appears lighter and clickable.  Animation entrances were also added to every page.  Every time a user clicks for a new Hurricane Fact, the fact will fade in and out instead of simply changing. The tredning page has been augmented with a live update of tweets with relevant hurricane related terms.

# Two User actions

1. The user can set their location on the home screen using the profile sidebar and view the live weather map based on their location in the maps tab. Their location will be stored in a cookie for future visits to the site.
2. The user can use the checklist to view what they need to prepare and to check off items. The items that are checked will be saved for future use.
