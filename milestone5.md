# How a user from our target population would use our app

Mark (user) and his family have just moved to Florida from California. He has no knowledge of hurricane preparedness when his next door neighbor shows him Hurrycane, an app that informs people in hurricane prone areas about preparedness and safety. He and his wife open the web app while at the store and use the checklist in the Preparations tab to stock up on their essentials in case of an emergency. There is information on what food to stock as well as other essentials such as tools and items for their baby and dog. As they fill their shopping cart with the essentials, they are able to check off and keep track of everything they have acquired. Once they are home, they start to plan for what's to come and examine the Shelters tab. They notice that it gives them information on nearby shelters and they keep note of that. On the Trending tab, the couple can be informed on the latest news regarding hurricanes, so they can be sure that they are up to date. Even though they just recently moved, they can be as prepared as anyone else who has lived in Florida for years.

# How UI Skeleton has improved

We have changed all of the pages to reflect a dark mode. This matches the home page's dark theme and helps the rest of the important information stand out. We added a Shelters page that now gives information on nearby shelters available based on the user's location. Our Preparations page now contains more information regarding the checklist. It saves the user's input regarding what they have and have not checked. We also improved the overall look of each card, removing the white border and adding curved edges, in order to separate each section more clearly. We added some loading animation to some pages to show feedback to users. Clicking on "Set My Location" now prompts you with a loading button. Incoming tweets in the Trending page now have an incoming animation, to show users that it is live information.
